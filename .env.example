# Copy to .env for local development: cp .env.example .env

# ⚠️  VITE_* variables are baked into the static bundle at BUILD time.
#     For Docker, pass them as build args (see docker-compose.yml or Dockerfile).
#     For Render, set them in the dashboard under Environment → the values are
#     injected automatically during the build (render.yaml already declares them).

# Backend API base URL

# Google OAuth client ID (must match the one configured in Google Cloud Console)
